# AdGuard Filters

This repository contains filters made for [AdGuard](https://balupton.com/adguard), which is the best adblocker I have ever come across. If you also like [AdGuard](https://balupton.com/adguard) as much as I do, [recommend it to others!](https://balupton.com/adguard/affiliate)

## Usage

Copy the URL of the filter you wish to subscribe to, add to AdGuard via "Add a Custom Filter" and paste in the URL. Enable `Trusted Filter` to receive automatic updates.

Note that any filter allows us to inject anything into any website, so if you do not trust us, then view the rules you are adding and disable `Trusted Filter` to prevent automatic updates. Alternatively, you can [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/working-with-forks) this repository and replace `bevry-labs` with your own username.
